# Fuzzy-Control
In this practice, I theoretically designed a controller using the projection operator from algebra, satisfying constraints of the desired trajectory and the remote center of motion. See the simplified picture below to get the constraints roughly:

Then, I constructed a suitable Lyapunov function to prove the stability of the designed controller mentioned above.
