# Fuzzy-Control
In this practice, I theoretically designed a controller using the projection operator from algebra, satisfying the constraints (in red color) of the desired trajectory and the desired remote center of motion in surgical scenarios. See the simplified picture below to get the constraints roughly:

Then, I constructed a suitable Lyapunov function to prove the stability of the designed controller mentioned above.
